            explanation of how to use each page, and what to expect.</p>

            <p><em><strong>About</strong></em></p>
            <p>This section briefly details what the service stands for. This should give you an idea of whether they can
            possibly help or not. It also gives an image of the building in which the service is located, which
            should help any students who are feeling unsure of a service\'s location.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Services</strong></em></p>
            <p>This section covers what they can provide for the student. For example, if a student is viewing the Disability Services
            topic then this section would list an example of areas in which those staff can assist.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Contact</strong></em></p>
            <p>This section covers how to contact the Service that was chosen. Here you can find directions to the building,
            the postal address, opening hours, and other contact information such as the telephone number, email and web-page if
            applicable. A student can simply click on the telephone number, email or web-page to be taken to the relevant

            <p><em><strong>About</strong></em></p>
            <p>This section will go into details on what the mental health illness is, and how it begins to develop. Here you can
            typically find the information such as symptoms.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Treatment</strong></em></p>
            <p>This section covers suggested treatments for the selected Mental health topic. This can range from medication, to
            general advice, and even counselling suggestions. Please take the time to read this section thoroughly if you feel you
            are suffering from a Mental Health illness. It is important to note that this section is not always present as in some
            instances there are no treatments; such as the <strong>Friendship</strong> section. While this is a Mental Health topic,
            as having strong friendships and socialising can promote good Mental Health, it is not an illness directly and therefore
            there is no treatment section.</p>]]>

            of staff and student professional learning and development with potential for collaboration with other partners across
            the institution, the provision of secondment opportunities, and partnership working with DUSA.</p>

            counselling might help to clarify the issues.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Anxiety</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Loneliness</p>
            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Perfectionism</p>

            <p>It\'s healthier to explore it with an experienced counsellor than bottle it up and never see an improvement.

            concerns about their money.</p>

            <p>Students wishing to apply for financial aid should download the application form available from our website.
            All applications are treated in the strictest confidence and information will not be shared outside the
            department without the student\'s permission.</p>

            <p>Students from the EU/other international countries are expected to have sufficient funds available for them for the
            duration of their course. However, we do understand that unexpected problems may arise during a student\'s period of
            study and all students are encouraged to approach the Student Funding Unit to discuss their situation. More often than
            not, clear information and guidance can be more helpful to resolve a situation.</p>

            <p>Essentially, if you have any query about your student funding or general financial issues, please do come and see us.
            Our service is free, impartial and confidential.</p>]]>

            We do ourselves and others harm by not sorting out our problems with anger. Surveys have shown that <em>depression</em>,
            <em>acute anxiety</em>, <em>heart disease</em>, <em>ulcers</em> are some of the ailments that are the result of unresolved
            and badly managed anger. We can also suffer headaches, being emotionally withdrawn from those we love and financially
            pressured if we need to replace things we have broken during our anger outbursts.</p>

            <p>We may lose relationships and friendships if people get tired of our hurtful and angry comments so don\'t invite us
            to be with them. The outcomes of anger are personal and different but they all leave us with negative feelings and more
            problems to solve.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[<h1 id=headerTag>The Four Components</h1>]]>
        </item>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[<p>Anger can really prevent us from relating and performing as well as we can. When this happens we may regret our
            behaviour and wonder why it has actually happened. There are four components to getting angry listed below.</p>

            <h4 id=headerTag><u>1) Triggers</u></h4>
            <p>There are many different anger triggers. Often things affecting us in childhood stay with us as we become adults and
            affect our reactions. We form expectations of others and ourselves and when they are not met we feel angry. Examples are
            others not acting as we do, not being acknowledged, having to wait in a queue for ages, feeling discounted or misunderstood.</p>

            <p>Finding out why we react angrily can help us to explore ways of changing our behaviour. If we can think through why we
            feel so angry we can begin to work through those feelings and let go of them, acknowledging that we were justified having them
            as children but expressing them now as adults puts us in different situations.</p>]]>
        </item>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[
            <p><em><strong>Unrealistic Expectations</strong></em></p>
            <p>Sometimes we expect everyone else to live by our standards and when they don\'t we get very annoyed. How reasonable
            are we being? If I am on the train planning to study or hoping to concentrate on a book, am I justified in expecting
            everyone else on the train to be quiet? Realizing that this will not necessarily be the case I have a choice about
            whether I let others talking etc get to me or not.</p>

            <p>I may also have the option of moving my seat to a quieter carriage. Try and look for the unrealistic expectations you have
            of others and yourself and see what arouses your anger. If you can understand where your expectations came from, you may well
            be able to change some of them so that you don\'t become angry. The positive result of this is that you will be less stressed.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Unhelpful Thoughts</strong></em></p>
            <p>We can think in unhelpful ways about people and situations when our anger is triggered. What we need is to find ways of
            changing how we think. For example, if you are waiting for someone and they are late, you can either feel slighted,
            disrespected, annoyed for being left waiting, think they are doing it on purpose; all of which illicit angry feelings.</p>

            <p>Alternatively you can rationalize that they don\'t usually behave like this so are not being deliberately annoying, or
            acknowledge that something has held them up. Thinking in this way helps keep you in a sunnier frame of mind when you do
            finally meet so that the planned meeting does not start on the wrong foot.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Old Resentments</strong></em></p>
            <p>Resentments held can cause innocent remarks to trigger our anger. Becoming as self aware as possible can help us
            recognize why we react angrily. How we have been treated in the past can set us up for small remarks to trigger strong
            feelings of anger, which are out of proportion to the remark.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[
            <h4 id=headerTag><u>2) Thoughts</u></h4>
            <p>Our thoughts have a major effect on how we react to situations. For example if we get up feeling negative we drain
            ourselves of energy and set ourselves up for having a bad day. How we perceive things like having a lot to do makes a
            difference to how we react. If we have a lot to do this in itself does not have the power to determine that we will have
            a headache, cause stress or tension. It depends much more on our attitude to having a lot to do. </p>

            <p>To change our actions we need to change our way of thinking, which takes time and practice as we challenge ourselves
            about how we habitually think and react. Sometimes people experience \'cognitive distortion\', which is when they make a
            problem bigger than it actually is, reading meanings into things that aren\'t there. This can increase feelings of anger.
            If that becomes severe, cognitive behavioural therapy can be helpful.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[
            <h4 id=headerTag><u>3) Feelings</u></h4>
            <p>When our security and safety are threatened we react with the \'fight or flight\' mechanism. This causes a release of
            chemicals into the body, which we experience as fear, muscular tension, pounding heart, faster breathing. This can be
            very useful, but it kicks in whenever we perceive a threat and can increase our anger response if our self-talk has
            magnified an event.</p>

            <p>E.g. you have group work to finish, other group members are \'too slow\' doing their bit, and because you fear
            failure you get angry with them, although you will meet the deadline.</p>]]>

            <h4 id=headerTag><u>4) Behaviour</u></h4>
            <p>When we feel really angry it is hard to accept the fact that we have a choice about what we do with our anger.
            We do not have to take it out on other people. Read the following and see if you express your anger in any of these ways:</p>]]>
        </item>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[
            <p><em><strong>Passive/Aggressive Behaviour</strong></em></p>
            <p>Becoming very quiet; withdrawing and refusing to communicate, denying anger, being uncooperative on purpose;
            acting in ways to upset or show the other how badly you feel.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Sarcasm</strong></em></p>
            <p>Insulting the other, putting them down \'humorously\', facial expression or tone of voice
            conveying criticism or contempt.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Cold Anger</strong></em></p>
            <p>Withdrawing and staying silent, making people work hard to reach you, which you may secretly enjoy;
            punishing them emotionally for how you feel.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Hostility</strong></em></p>
            <p>You don\'t handle stress well and become loud and forceful, which makes others uncomfortable; you are vocal
            about your expectations not being met, expressing intrusive and stressful opinions about and to others.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Aggression</strong></em></p>
            <p>Exploding verbally, shouting and wanting to get your own back; intimidating the other emotionally and/or physically;
            this includes, holding, blocking, pushing, hitting, restraining; this type of behaviour is the most serious and may
            require specialist help when levels of verbal and physical abuse are harming others.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[
            <h4 id=headerTag><u>1) Taking time out</u></h4>

            <p>We can change so that anger does not affect so much in our lives by becoming as self aware as we can.
            This means noticing how and why we are reacting to things and reflecting on that awareness before we act. In doing
            this we are taking time to think about what we want to do rather than being taken over by strong feelings that can lead
            to actions we later regret. </p>

            <p>When a situation looks as though it may turn into an angry argument you could take time out. Say to the
            other person that you need a few minutes to think and if necessary leave the room and have a walk while you think
            things through.</p>]]>
        </item>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[
            <h4 id=headerTag><u>2) Deep Breathing</u></h4>

            <p>Another version of this is to sit down if you are standing up, sit back in your chair and take a few deep breaths
            while you think to yourself \'I am just going to distance myself emotionally and regain control, get hold of my rational
            self again\'. Calming yourself down by breathing exercises does help.</p>]]>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[
            <h4 id=headerTag><u>3) Humour</u></h4>

            <p> Generate an alternative form of physical arousal by channelling your energy into humour.</p>]]>

            mattress; throwing stones into the sea/river; screaming; crying; running/going to the gym; walking/marching/hill walking;
            cleaning a room; writing a letter without sending it, etc.</p>]]>

            All of us experience some anxiety from time to time.<br><br>
            This is normal and may help us cope with a difficult or stressful situation. Feeling anxious before an examination for
            example increases the levels of adrenaline and other stress related hormones in our bodies and enhances performance.
            We are more alert and clear thinking. Normal anxiety is rarely problematic and once the stressful situation passes we
            quickly return to normal.</p>

            <p>An anxiety problem is a more severe form of normal anxiety. It is more intense, more frequent or longer lasting and
            can become a habit that is difficult to break. Severe or chronic anxiety can stop you doing many things in your
            day-to-day life. You may be unable to walk down the street, go to the supermarket, into a lecture theatre or a pub
            without feeling anxious, uncomfortable and upset.</p>

            <p>Over time you may avoid going to these places to avoid feeling so bad. In the long-term anxiety may make holding down
            a job very difficult or impossible. Enjoying leisure time and forming rewarding relationships will become increasingly
            problematic. An anxiety problem is not a physical illness but health problems may develop if anxiety persists for a
            long time. Depression creeps in.</p>

            <p>The immune system becomes less effective in fighting off infections. High blood pressure can cause heart problems.
            The digestive system functions less efficiently, leading to ulcers and other digestive disorders. Some skin conditions
            are associated with anxiety. Some people suffer hair loss. Of course these health issues can have other causes; it is
            important to be in touch with your doctor.</p>]]>

            When you are anxious your body reacts in certain ways that can be helpful in dealing with whatever it is that is making
            you anxious. Your mind believes that you are in danger and this triggers the production of certain chemicals, or stress
            hormones, in your body that prepare you to face the danger or harm. The body and mind reactions are the same whether
            you are facing actual danger (a street mugger) or a perceived but distorted danger (standing quietly in the supermarket
            queue).</p>

            <p>The effects of these hormones in your bloodstream can be strong and overwhelming. When faced with real danger your
            body will quickly utilise these chemicals to help you fight the mugger or save yourself by running away. The associated
            physical sensations will quickly subside as the chemicals are used up, although you may feel shaky for a while
            afterwards. This is called the <strong>fight or flight response</strong>.</p>

            <p>If the danger is not real, as in the supermarket queue, then the chemicals are not used up and continue to
            circulate in your body, leading to the physical sensations mentioned above. A panic attack occurs when there is an
            extra strong surge of stress hormones that aren\'t rapidly used up and can\'t be dispersed quickly enough by the
            body\'s natural internal balancing mechanism.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[
            <p>Panic attacks often come unexpectedly. If you don\'t know what is happening to you, or if you have never had one
            before the experience can be very frightening. You may think that you are going mad, that you are having a heart
            attack or going to die. None of these are likely because of a panic attack, but see your GP if you are worried
            about your health and need some reassurance.</p>

            <p>A panic attack may have an identifiable trigger or cause; if you are terrified of spiders and one falls on your head
            you may panic. Usually the cause is more complex and less obvious. See the previous paragraph <em>Why do you feel so bad</em>.
            A panic attack is the most severe form of acute anxiety and what happens in your body is in response to, not the cause of,
            a sudden, excessive amount of adrenaline and other hormones in your bloodstream.</p>

            <p>The trigger is usually psychological (your belief that a situation is threatening) but may be physical (intake of
            a substance that disturbs your body\'s equilibrium in some way) or a combination of the two. If you wait the symptoms
            of panic subside and you will return to normal. As this can take between 5 and 20 minutes most people find it
            extremely difficult to just wait.</p>

            <p>Your own fear of what is happening sets off further panic and more adrenaline is produced. This fear of fear
            means you are hypersensitive to your own body sensations and as soon as you feel anything that reminds you of a
            previous panic you tense up, thus making a further panic attack more likely. Remember that feeling very hot or a
            bit dizzy can be because of other things, such as sitting in an overheated, stuffy room, being hungry or dehydrated.</p>

            <p>One of the most common causes of a panic attack is hyperventilation, or overbreathing. We do this to meet extra
            demand from our muscles for oxygen (the fight or flight response). As the body tries to take in more oxygen our
            breathing rate increases as it would if we were running. However when anxious we tend to tense up, making our
            breathing shallower and faster.</p>

            <p>Our lungs can\'t fully inflate with each breath when our chest muscles are tight. Shallow, rapid breathing and
            over-breathing disturb the balance of carbon dioxide in our bodies and can bring on symptoms of panic. The same
            physiological reactions can happen after taking certain drugs.</p>]]>

            <p>It is possible to control anxiety, to reduce it to an acceptable and manageable level or even get rid of the
            problem completely. It isn\'t easy but is very worthwhile when you think of how much more enjoyable life will be
            when you aren\'t so anxious all the time.</p>

            <p>Courses of action will be much the same whether your anxiety is clearly defined, (e.g. exam anxiety or fear of flying)
            or more generalised and without an obvious cause. The most important thing to bear in mind is that you <strong>can and
            will overcome your anxiety problem</strong>, with a bit of work and perhaps some outside help.</p>]]>

            In counselling you explore what is worrying you. A counsellor
            can help you understand what is happening to you, what your anxiety may be related to and may teach techniques
            to control the symptoms. Counsellors use different approaches but all are there to listen to you and support you.
            A counsellor will help you find other help if that is thought necessary. The University counsellors have plenty
            of experience in helping students and staff with anxiety.</p>]]>

            <p id=headerTag><em><strong>Drugs</strong></em><br>
            Minor tranquillisers, sleeping pills and/or beta-blockers are prescribed frequently to
            help anxiety problems. These help control the physical symptoms and do have a place in treatment of chronic and
            acute anxiety. However some drugs are addictive and drugs alone don\'t tackle the source of the anxiety.
            Once the drugs are withdrawn the anxiety problem invariably returns.</p>

            <p>If you are depressed because of your anxiety anti-depressants may be prescribed. These can be helpful on
            their own but may be more effective when combined with counselling. Always keep in touch with your doctor if
            you are prescribed medication.</p>

            <p>Some non-prescription drugs cause or exacerbate anxiety and lead to panic attacks. Included here are alcohol,
            caffeine, nicotine and use of other substances. The anxiety may occur while taking these substances or some time
            afterwards. You may feel very good at the time but extremely anxious on waking the next morning. Watch out for
            combinations of different substances; the effects may be unpredictable and inconsistent.</p>]]>

            <p id=headerTag><em><strong>Have a look at your lifestyle</strong></em><br>
             It is always worth reviewing your diet. Fluctuating blood sugar
            levels lead to bodily sensations similar to anxiety in some people. Try to eat regularly, with plenty of complex
            carbohydrates (bread, potatoes, pasta) and fewer simple carbohydrate foods (biscuits, chocolate bars, crisps, fizzy
            drinks, beer).</p>

            <p>A cola drink and a cigarette for breakfast isn\'t the best start to the day. Exercise is a very effective means
            of reducing stress and using up the stress-related hormones in your body that accompany anxiety. This need not
            be too strenuous or competitive.</p>

            <p>Walking, swimming, cycling are fine. Having fun, laughing and relaxing also help you feel good. When busy and
            under pressure from work, exams, family or personal problems we tend to let these slip, just when we need
            more of them to help us keep anxiety at bay.</p>]]>

            Keeping your general anxiety levels as low as possible will minimise the likelihood of panic attacks. Check out
            the advice given earlier in this leaflet on how to reduce your anxiety. You may not realise just how anxious you are.</p>

            <p><em><strong>If you begin to feel panicky</strong></em><br>
            Stop what you are doing and try to regulate your breathing.
            Fairly slow, steady breathing will rapidly reduce the horrible sensations. Concentrate on your breathing
            rather than on the bodily sensations. Practise this method of breathing when you are not panicking so
            that you find it easier to do when you need it.</p>

            <p>Breathing slowly and regularly in and out of a paper bag held over your mouth and nose for about 10 minutes
            works very well. Carry one around in your pocket. Even cupping your hands over your mouth and nose can help
            raise the levels of carbon dioxide in your blood and reduce the sensations. Try running on the spot, or doing
            something else physical to use up the adrenaline.</p>

            <p>Some people find that shouting or singing very loudly is effective. Eating or drinking something sweet can also
            help if you think that your panic is associated with low blood sugar. If you think that your (or someone else\'s)
            panic attack is because of taking drugs seek medical help at once.</p>

            <p>If you have tried all the self-help methods without success or your life is being disrupted by panic and anxiety
            do seek help. Doctors and counsellors are very familiar with these difficulties and will be ready to help you.</p>]]>

            <p>Depression is more than simply feeling unhappy or fed up for a few days. Most people will go through periods of feeling
            down, but when you\'re depressed you feel persistently sad for weeks or months, rather than just a few days.</p>

            <p>As with most Mental Health issues, there is a stigma surrounding Depression. A large number of people view it as
            an <em>imaginary</em> illness. They\'re wrong – it is a real illness with real symptoms.</p>

            <p>It\'s common for people to worry that showing signs of a Mental Health illness can be a sign of weakness. This is also wrong.
            It\'s not uncommon for depression to be the opposite, and in fact be the result of a person who has fought hard mentally and physically
            for an extended period. It\'s not something you can "snap out of" and should not be seen as a weakness.</p>

            <p>The good news is that with the right treatment and support, most people with depression can make a full recovery. Sadly, many
            people lack the correct support as the stigma associated with Mental illness\'s in society is growing. It\'s crucial to raise
            awareness of Mental illness\'s such as Depression.</p>

            <p>It\'s common to feel as if no one would be willing to listen if you experience Depression. That\'s wrong. People will listen,
            and it is a topic which should be discussed openly. It\'s very likely that other people around you have experienced similar
            feelings at some point, as it\'s a very common Mental illness.</p>

                <p><strong>Depression symptoms can vary from mild to severe and can include:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Feeling sad or having a depressed mood</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Changes in appetite — weight loss or gain unrelated to dieting</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Loss of energy or increased fatigue</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Increase in purposeless physical activity (e.g., hand-wringing or pacing) or slowed movements and speech (actions observable by others)</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Feeling worthless or guilty</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Difficulty thinking, concentrating or making decisions</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Thoughts of death or suicide</p>

                <p>Symptoms must last at least two weeks for a diagnosis of depression.</p>

                </p>Also, medical conditions (e.g., thyroid problems, a brain tumor or vitamin deficiency) can mimic symptoms of
                depression so it is important to rule out general medical causes.</p>

                <p>Depression affects an estimated one in 15 adults (6.7&#37;) in any given year. And one in six people (16.6&#37;)
                will experience depression at some time in their life. Depression can strike at any time, but on average, first
                appears during the late teens to mid-20s. Women are more likely than men to experience depression. Some studies show
                that one-third of women will experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime.</p>

                having a baby, can bring it on.</p>

                <p>People with a family history of depression are more likely to experience it themselves. But you can also become
                depressed for no obvious reason.</p>

                <p>Depression is fairly common, affecting about one in 10 people at some point during their life. It affects men and
                women, young and old. Studies have shown that about 4&#37; of children aged five to 16 in the UK are anxious or depressed.</p>

                <p>If you are given a diagnosis of depression, you might be told that you have mild, moderate or severe depression.
                This describes what sort of impact your symptoms are having on you currently, and what sort of treatment you\'re likely
                to be offered. You might move between different mild, moderate and severe depression during one episode of

                <p>There are also some specific types of depression:</p>

                <p><em><strong>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD)</strong></em></p>
                <p>Depression that usually (but not always) occurs in the winter. SAD Association provides information and advice.
                Google the info page on SAD for more information.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Dysthymia</strong></em></p>
                <p>Continuous mild depression that lasts for two years or more. Also called persistent depressive disorder or chronic depression.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Prenatal depression</strong></em></p>
                <p>Sometimes also called antenatal depression, it occurs during pregnancy.</p>
                <p><em><strong>Postnatal depression (PND)</strong></em></p>
                <p>Occurs in the weeks and months after becoming a parent. Postnatal depression is usually diagnosed in women but it can affect men, too.</p>

            <p>Depression is among the most treatable of mental disorders. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of people with depression
            eventually respond well to treatment. Almost all patients gain some relief from their symptoms.</p>

            <p>Before a diagnosis or treatment, a health professional should conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including an
            interview and possibly a physical examination. In some cases, a blood test might be done to make sure the
            depression is not due to a medical condition like a thyroid problem. The evaluation is to identify specific symptoms,
            medical and family history, cultural factors and environmental factors to arrive at a diagnosis and plan a course of action.</p>

            <h4 id=headerTag><u>Medication</u></h4>
            <p>Brain chemistry may contribute to an individual\’s depression and may factor into their treatment. For this reason,
            antidepressants might be prescribed to help modify one\’s brain chemistry. These medications are not sedatives, \“uppers\” or
            tranquilizers. They are not habit-forming. Generally antidepressant medications have no stimulating effect on
            people not experiencing depression.</p>

            <p>Antidepressants may produce some improvement within the first week or two of use. Full benefits may not be seen
            for two to three months. If a patient feels little or no improvement after several weeks, his or her psychiatrist can
            alter the dose of the medication or add or substitute another antidepressant. In some situations other psychotropic
            medications may be helpful. It is important to let your doctor know if a medication does not work or if you experience
            side effects.</p>

            <p>Psychiatrists usually recommend that patients continue to take medication for six or more months after symptoms have
            improved. Longer-term maintenance treatment may be suggested to decrease the risk of future episodes for certain people
            at high risk.</p>

            <h4 id=headerTag><u>Psychotherapy</u></h4>
            <p>Psychotherapy, or \“talk therapy,\” is sometimes used alone for treatment of mild depression; for moderate to severe
            depression, psychotherapy is often used in along with antidepressant medications. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has
            been found to be effective in treating depression. CBT is a form of therapy focused on the present and problem solving.
            CBT helps a person to recognize distorted thinking and then change behaviors and thinking.</p>

            <p>Psychotherapy may involve only the individual, but it can include others. For example, family or couples therapy can help address issues within these close relationships.
            Group therapy involves people with similar illnesses.</p>

            <p>Depending on the severity of the depression, treatment can take a few weeks or much longer. In many cases, significant
            improvement can be made in 10 to 15 sessions..</p>

            <div>
            <h4 id=headerTag><u>Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)</u></h4>

            <p>This is a medical treatment most commonly used for patients with severe major depression or bipolar disorder who have
            not responded to other treatments. It involves a brief electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under
            anesthesia. A patient typically receives ECT two to three times a week for a total of six to 12 treatments.
            ECT has been used since the 1940s, and many years of research have led to major improvements. It is usually managed by a
            team of trained medical professionals including a psychiatrist, an anesthesiologist and a nurse or physician assistant.</p>

            <p>There are a number of things people can do to help reduce the symptoms of depression. For many people, regular exercise
            helps create positive feeling and improve mood. Getting enough quality sleep on a regular basis, eating a
            healthy diet and avoiding alcohol (a depressant) can also help reduce symptoms of depression.</p>

            <p>Depression is a real illness and help is available. With proper diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people
            with depression will overcome it. If you are experiencing symptoms of depression, a first step is to see your family
            physician or psychiatrist. Talk about your concerns and request a thorough evaluation. This is a start to addressing
            mental health needs.</p>

            <![CDATA[<h1 id=headerTag>Our Take On Friendship</h1>]]>
        </item>

        <item><![CDATA[
            <p>Friendship is about warmth and laughter and spontaneity, about staying in touch with our feelings and sharing them,
             about caring both when it is easy and when things are difficult. It\'s about expressing our anger and irritation and
             knowing that it\'s safe to do so, and it\'s about a thousand and one things, both great and small, that are part of
             strengthening the bonds between us.</p>

             <p>For some people the first few months at university can be quite a scary time. Knowing how long it took to make
             friends at school, it can be daunting and a bit despairing to be surrounded by so many new faces. It can feel
             really awkward to sit at breakfast alongside a complete stranger, and be stuck for conversation.
             It can be a worry when you are unsure about how to write an essay or lab report and feel
             you have no one in whom to confide. You may start to dread those long weekends when everything seems so quiet.</p>

             <p>Compared to school the structure of university life is deliberately loose and flexible, centred on a core of
             mandatory formal work of perhaps fifteen to twenty hours. There is time and the opportunity for making friends in
             the residences, in flats, in sports and leisure activities and in social situations. Ironically, for those who are
             feeling quite lonely, there may never be another time when there are so many potential friendships around and the
             time to indulge them.</p>

             <p>Physical attraction can be overwhelming - it\'s a big part of relationships and we wouldn\'t survive without it!
             Sometimes it\'s all that\'s going for a relationship, and sometimes it\'s all we want, but usually we\'re looking
             for other things as well… a sense of humour, kindness, generosity… the list is endless! And it\'s reassuring to
             know that - however it\'s dressed up - a good relationship often feels more like a pair of old slippers,
             than something smart or sexy or elegant… just familiar and comfortable.</p>

             <p>So much of our time at university is spent in a flurry of activity which - to be honest - doesn\'t really do
             much for relationships.</p>

             <p>Moving from mutual attraction to developing a genuine liking can be quite a slow process - it takes time
             before we\'re ready to trust and confide in others, time also to test what kinds of potential hurt or
             distress might be lurking in the shadows.</p>

             <p>To know another person is to share many different experiences, it is to learn something of the depth and colour
             of another\'s feelings - the humour, joy, sadness, humility, anger, patience, shame - and of those basic
             attitudes to life that inform his or her personality. It\'s a process whose gentle momentum runs counter
             to a culture in which the common expectation is that most things can be made to happen quickly.
             But emotional intimacy is a strange thing: for though it can often arise in abrupt and unexpected moments,
             and often has little to do with sex, yet it thrives both in conditions of gentle nurture and frank avowal
             or outspokenness.</p>

             <p>It\'s been said that a good test of a relationship is to convince two friends that they spend time in
             a remote bothy in the Highlands with the minimum of conveniences. A few days of discomfort - as the adversity
             of the situation becomes apparent - is usually sufficient for each to see the other as he or she really is.
             So many of our relationships develop in sheltered, contrived situations, that living under difficult
             conditions for a short period - no electricity and no plumbing - can quickly bring out both the best and the
             worst in us! It\'s good to know that a friend can be relied upon to be considerate and patient… it\'s also useful
             to know what makes a friend feel grumpy or embarrassed and angry.</p>

             <p>Warmth, understanding and acceptance seem to be at the core of friendship… creating conditions where the other
             person feels safe, respected and appreciated. Safety is about your friend knowing that he or she will not feel
             diminished or abused or harassed; respect involves being aware of your friend\'s feelings, needs and boundaries;
             appreciation means celebrating your friendship openly both in word and action. So often, when we look back on
             relationships, we regret all the good things that were left unsaid and undone.</p>

             <p>Friendship can become very intense and committed, with two people totally absorbed in each other\'s company
             to the exclusion of their previous friends. It\'s a heady experience and fine while it lasts! But at the end
             of the day we need our wider circle of friends, to share the good times and to keep alive all those aspects of
             ourselves that they alone can nourish.</p>

             <p>We go through the first half of our lives at school, then university, then chasing jobs, moving every few years,
             to become familiar with relationships that are transient. It\`s a part of adapting for a short time to new
             surroundings. At the same time we also build up a small group of more lasting friends -
             those we\'ve learned to trust and want to keep. Most of us can think of friends that we see only rarely,
             and yet - when we meet - it\'s as though we were never parted.</p>

             <p>Towards the end of our lives when we are sitting in the proverbial rocking chair and casting back over our
             relationships it would be nice if each one of us could name at least four or five people who we\'ve truly and
             deeply loved. Sometimes they\'ll be relatives, often they\'ll be friends. Sometimes we meet them early in our lives,
             but often later, when we\'ve finished with formal education.</p>

             <p>But if it remains true that the circle of our love and intimacy must always remain circumscribed by the
             limits that deep affections place on us, the wings of friendship are many and glorious, and can take us
             to the most unexpected and inspiring of landfalls. It is in friendships that we look after those aspects
             of ourselves that are often neglected. And it is the breadth and depth of our friendships that we can learn
             to share what it is that we have in our hearts to give.</p>]]>

            <p>It is for quite a few people. In fact close on 70% of students - two out
            of three - feel homesick to some extent over the first six weeks at University. Sometimes the symptoms are mild, like
            feeling a bit disorientated and muddled and unsure how to manage things in a new place. But some people take longer
            to settle - perhaps most of the first semester - and some of their feelings will be pretty acute, even overwhelming,
            at times.<br><br>

            <div>
            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> First of all admit that you are homesick and accept that it\'s totally ok to feel homesick.
            There\'s nothing \'weak\' or \'wimpish\' about homesickness. On the contrary, it takes strength to confront your
            feelings and to do something about them.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Talk to someone. If you haven\'t yet made any friends, try the Counselling Service, the
            Chaplaincy Centre, or Joan at Peer Connections. You can find contact details for all of them in the <strong>University Services
            </strong> section of this app.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Use your phone. Text people. Send emails. They\'re great ways to stay in
            touch and keep friendships going.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Make sure your room is decorated with familiar items from home, such as photos,
            posters, stuffed animals, plants, etc. It\'s not a childish, self-indulgent thing to do. It\'s a
            really good way of making yourself at home in new surroundings.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Don\'t make any major decisions. Even if you eventually decide that you don\'t want to stay,
            take your time and talk to people.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Keep busy. Get into a routine. The fuller your days are,
            the less time for feeling homesick or lonely.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Treat yourself to food that you enjoy.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Walk around. Explore your new surroundings.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Be realistic about student life. It\'s not expected that you will work 168
            hours a week, and you couldn\'t even if you tried. 30-35 hours will do nicely, and leave
            you plenty of time for making friends and leisure activities.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Plan a date to go home and make firm arrangements.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> If you can\'t eat or sleep properly see your GP or the doctor at the
            University Health Service.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Volunteer to help with something. There are plenty of groups looking for volunteers. Contact DUSA or the
            Chaplaincy Centre.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Don\'t expect to get everything right. You\'re bound to make mistakes, forget things,
            get lost, etc. First year is all about getting it wrong, wasting time, not understanding it, feeling dead stupid.
            There will be plenty of time to catch up after all it\'s common for people to be down with flu for a few weeks
            and still get through the year successfully.​</div>

            <![CDATA[
            <p>
            Often when we question our capacity for suffering, we wonder at the extremes of pain to which individuals are
            sometimes subject.</p>

            <p>And in our minds we see not the person who is bearing the pain, but a measure of pain that is coloured by the
            limits of our own experience. The same is true of loneliness. For when we witness the grieving of a mother
            for the child she has lost to sickness, or the sadness of the abandoned lover, or the man who mourns the passing
            of his father, we are held in the palm of our own imaginings. The extent of another\'s loneliness is truly
            difficult to grasp.</p>

            <p>What is the effect of loneliness? Well, often it drives us to join, mix with others, to be in company when we
            would really prefer it otherwise. You can see this a lot in first-year, when everyone feels that they have to
            go out in droves, rather than do things on their own. You can see it in the way that some people will not
            willingly enter a new activity without a companion at their side. How some are often reluctant to go to
            the cinema on their own, or eat by themselves in a restaurant. Even at Christmas, which is a time of
            tension for some families, people are very reluctant to be on their own… far better to bicker with relatives
            than to be left out of the family circle!</p>

            <p>Although we are a gregarious species, much of our togetherness at a superficial level has to do with our
            reluctance or inability to be alone. Relationships are another example… it\'s sometimes quite difficult for a
            person to establish the amount of personal space that they want in an intimate relationship, time when each
            partner needs to be alone - not to feel lonely, but to enjoy activities that require solitude. It\'s particularly
            difficult for busy parents to establish that space, labouring against the common view that seeking such space
            is actually quite selfish.</p>

            <p>Solitude feels very different from loneliness. There\'s a gentleness and a quiet sense of contentment about
            solitude which enables us to become immersed in a wide range of activities, such as reading, listening to music,
            painting, hill-walking and a host of other hobbies. It seems to touch on a basic need for peace and harmony.
            It allows us to draw on our sources of inspiration and creativity.</p>

            <p>Fear of being lonely is one of the key issues in binding people together. It\'s particularly evident when a
            couple start to feel like going their separate ways. It\'s a fear of loneliness that often creates the eddies
            and backsliding, hindering a partner from saying, \'it\'s not working out. I don\'t wish to be in this relationship
            any longer.\' And often, because our emotional life is coloured by melodrama, by a propensity to see things in
            black and white, we see the loneliness as fathomless, as much more acute than it could ever be.</p>

            <p>We are all lonely to a greater or lesser extent… and yet how often do we hear the comment: \'Oh, she\'s quite a
            lonely person\' as though we are defining a state that carries some explanatory and predictive value. And how
            often is it a way of stigmatising a person, and diminishing them?</p>

            <p>None of us wants to experience the full extent of our loneliness, the extent to which each of us owns a
            unique and ultimately unshareable existence. We are all aware that we have aspects of ourselves that are not
            loveable, or accepted, or understood by others.</p>

            <p>Many of us will entertain occasional fantasies in which some of our needs are met in ways that reality
            does not allow for… a world which tells us something about the extent of our loneliness and about how
            we are unable or unwilling to share with those around us in the full expression of our existence.</p>

            <p>Often the extent of our loneliness is only evident in retrospect, when we are able - from the vantage point
            of a satisfying relationship - to look back on earlier relationships and discover how restrictive they were. So,
            for much of our lives, we existed in an emotional world that was relatively impoverished and lonely compared
            to what it became… at the time it was a bit like being unaware of what we were missing in our diet.</p>

            <p>Our surroundings have powerful ways of reinforcing our loneliness. One example is advertising. What does
            advertising promise? Power, status, yes - but - more than those two - a \'feel-good\' factor… buy this and you will
            feel better, happier, more secure and - not least - less lonely. Advertising is about making you feel that
            without the shoes, the shampoo, the clothes, etc., you will not feel part of the world around you… that you
            will be left out., that if you don\'t buy or cannot buy something then you\'re outside the magic circle. It
            is concerned with the child in us that wants to be included, wants to be part of what is going on… you have
            only to see the number of people eager to buy clothes with designer labels to realise what a powerful effect such
            insignia can have on their owners.</p>

            <p>When we feel lonely, we lose that feeling of entitlement, that feeling of membership, that feeling
            of access to the benefits that a relationship automatically confers. Sometimes people will try to reduce
            acute feelings of loneliness and isolation by indulging in spending sprees, as if the possession
            of something physical could dispel the inner emotional pangs. So loneliness is not a simple thing, except
            in its powerful dynamic… there are many layers to it in terms of how we interpret our loss and isolation,
            and many powerful ways in which these are reinforced in our environment.</p>

            <p>Loneliness is like sitting on a hill and looking into the distance, but not actually seeing much of the view…
            because a mist blurs the shapes on the horizon. Loneliness is such a powerful, primary feeling, and so
            at odds with our sense of emotional well-being, that it distorts all around it, making us unobservant and
            blind to those sources of support and comfort that actually lie close at hand.</p>

            <p>Loneliness resembles entering a hall of mirrors and seeing the familiar as something that\'s made painful and scary.
            It\'s also like looking at a distant table - out of reach and piled high with delicious food - and feeling that
            in your hunger you could quaff everything in sight, forgetting all the while that you don\'t require that much
            to sate your appetite… when we are lonely we don\'t actually need much in the way of company to banish the
            feeling… that\'s why pets play such an important role in our lives, and yet the feeling can be so insistent
            that it seems like our life needs to be changed out of all recognition if we are to feel less lonely.</p>

            <p>Another way of looking at loneliness is to turn the feeling upside-down and ask yourself, what would it be
            like not to be feeling lonely like this? Well, for a start it might involve a change of attitudes: you might
            share more of your life and be more generous in expressing your feelings, yours joys and sadness, be more open
            to the needs of others, freer with your time and efforts, and exist in a world in which giving not taking were
            the norm. You might feel more trusting and accepting of other people.</p>

            <p>The opposite of feeling lonely is not necessarily having another person in your life; it is about experiencing
            those feelings of openness, self-disclosure and acceptance that enable good relationships to exist. In fact before
            we can get near to sustaining deep and meaningful relationships we need to be confident in expressing and
            experiencing our feelings in ways that are modest but effective. We are often lonely not because we haven\'t got
            the right girlfriend or boyfriend, but perhaps because we have managed to cut ourselves off from others, and have
            lost confidence in our ability to relate in small but important ways to the world around.</p>

            <p>Another way of looking at loneliness is to ask yourself how do you relate to someone else who is feeling really
            lonely? It\'s partly a matter of understanding and acceptance but it is also a question of establishing the
            necessary degree of trust to break down the barriers, to enable that person to open up and start responding,
            to help them realise that making a relationship - even a casual, small relationship - isn\'t necessarily going
            to involve hurt and disappointment. Very often our loneliness is a prison of our own making, in which we
            take for granted that the walls are thick and stretch to the heavens, emotional prisons that are girded with
            all kinds of misperceptions, casting the world around us in the role of a jungle with no clearings or maybe of a
            polar night devoid of stars.</p>

            <p>Despite the hurts and frustrations in life, a loving, warm and intimate relationship is what most of us
            would wish for ourselves and others. And in that quality of relationship we see a particularly rich fulfilment
            of our humanity. A good relationship enables us to explore and experience a wide range of feelings.
            There is something lacking in a human being who has never loved, never hated, never grieved or felt alone.
            The range and depth of our feelings is the measure of our humanity. When we feel acutely alone, we are at
            our most human and most vulnerable. The length of shadow that loneliness casts on our lives is often a sign
            of how much else we are capable of feeling and sharing with others.</p>

            <p>Loneliness can dwell amid great anguish in the inner recesses of our hearts, and we may despair of finding
            a way to change our feelings. Yet with determination we can endow most of our hopes and wishes with a great
            measure of reality. Loneliness rarely lasts, and its span is dependent as much on our wishes and the course of
            our convictions as upon the changing nature of circumstances.</p>

            <p>It would be a capricious whim to dream of a world without loneliness, for that would deny us all
            those repeated experiences that carry important learning in helping us to value those whom we love and cherish.
            Our awareness of cold gives us a measure of heat. So it is with loneliness and the hand of friendship.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <p>Usually our most traumatic experiences of loss are when a loved one dies.</p>

            <p>The same kinds of feelings arise with other losses and separations. Loss can include the break-up of a
            relationship, a miscarriage, the termination of pregnancy, separation from family and friends (homesickness),
            loss of health, moving house. Other forms of loss may not be so devastating but can still touch us profoundly,
            such as the death of a pet or the loss of a possession with great sentimental value. Also if you happen to be
            a medical or nursing student, you may have experienced feelings of loss when a patient dies. With loss comes a
            strong feeling that part of our emotional world has changed forever and can never be retrieved or made good.</p>

            <p>Loss is central to our lives. We cannot avoid it. Just as the tree sheds its leaves, making visible the
            beauty of its structure, so does loss strip us down to our essential nature. Paradoxically it is in this
            period of seeming abandonment and vulnerability, that our inner strength comes to the fore. It is often through
            brokeness and loss that we truly grow into our humanity and develop the compassion that connects us to others.</p>

            <p>Following loss of any kind we go through a period of adjustment. This time and process is called grieving. It\'s
            important to remember that grief is natural and necessary. Though the range and intensity of grief may come
            as a surprise, it is an entirely normal process that has been with us since the beginning of time. And,
            of course, as we adjust and the bits of our emotional life start to settle into a new pattern, the grief
            gently recedes. Just as scar tissue is said to be stronger than the surrounding skin, so does our grieving
            often lead us to a state of greater resilience where we are more able to deal with future adversity.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[
            <p>Grief is the normal response to loss. The sense of helplessness and lack of hope is present to some
            degree in everyone who has suffered a loss. The expression of grief will vary across cultures and religions.
            Each has its own traditions and rituals associated with the mourning period. The marking of death in these ways
            is part of the healing process and helps in adjusting to life without the physical presence of the dead person.</p>

            <p>Each one of us contains both an adult and a child. As the adult seeks to make sense of loss and tries to
            do all the appropriate and sensible things, alongside this is the emotional inner child, with a different
            agenda, who usually feels confused and abandoned. While the adult struggles bravely on, the dependent inner
            child is desperate for consolation. So that grieving is often a seesawing between these two parts of
            ourselves, as we try to be reasonable, but we actually feel at sea, lost and awash in anguish.</p>

            <p>The journey from initial shock and disbelief to acceptance and emotional healing takes time. How long
            does it take? There is no answer. Its duration and its intensity depend on individual circumstances:
            our relationship with the deceased, the network of support that sustains us, previous experience of loss
            and all the other business of our lives. The grieving period can last from several weeks to months
            and sometimes years. There is a sense in which the grieving never ends, but fades gradually into the
            background of our lives, to be felt in occasional poignant moments.</p>

            <p>If our loss is sudden and traumatic, for example an accidental death or suicide, grief can be particularly
            acute. There may also be strong feelings of guilt, as we react to the enormity of the event. It\'s very easy to
            feel guilty when someone dies, guilt about all the things left unsaid or undone, guilt about those areas of
            neglect in our relationship with the deceased for which we irrationally feel we shoulder all the blame, all
            the responsibility. Strong feelings of anger may often be present, as we rail against the apparent unfairness
            of being abandoned and left to cope alone with all the heartache that death brings.</p>]]>

            <![CDATA[
            <p><em><strong>In the beginning</strong></em></p>

            <p>We will react with shock, disbelief, or denial even if death were expected. In the first hours or days
            we often feel numb or detached, as though we are observers watching a film. The shock may be such that we can\'t
            even remember what our loved one looked like. We may feel outwardly calm and be able to function mechanically,
            which is very self-deceptive given the nature of the situation.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we try to maintain a normal routine to retain some vestige of structure in our lives. Often in the aftermath of bereavement, how tidy and
            clean our flat or house becomes, as we set about our domestic chores for the tenth time! And we can laugh,
            in the midst of our utter desolation we can laugh and sometimes even joke. It all seems so contradictory and
            confusing. Yet we need the laughter to cope well with the sadness.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we feel like totally cutting ourselves off from our family and friends and lose any interest in
            what is going on around us. These are often good and healthy reactions: they serve us well and protect us against
            feeling uncomfortably exposed.</p>

            <p>We may experience all or none of these feelings. But however we react it\'s important to try and stay in touch
            with whatever changes are happening to us. It\'s really helpful to seek support at this time whatever the nature
            of the feelings and particularly if ideas of self-harm arise. Even the worst feelings will eventually pass, so it\'s
            vital that we don\'t let ourselves feel too overwhelmed or too isolated.</p>

            <p><em><strong>After a while</strong></em></p>

            <p>After a while once the numbness has subsided, we will become more fully aware of our loss. This can be the
            most distressing part of our grief, as we struggle with our distress. It can be difficult also for our friends who
            seek to provide us with understanding and support. It may take some time for the full extent of our loss to
            sink in.</p>

            <p>Typical signs at this time are a loss of appetite, anxiety, sleeplessness, frequent crying, sadness and hurt.
            Some people are known to have symptoms of physical illness similar to that of the dead person. We may have
            feelings of guilt or anger towards the lost loved one, a close friend, doctor or God. Or we turn
            inwards against ourselves. Some people see or hear the dead person or feel their presence.
            All of this is completely normal.</p>

            <p>At this time we tend to be disorganised, unable to make plans and forgetful. Our concentration may be upset.
            Our sleeping and eating patterns may be disturbed. Our ability to work or study could be badly affected.
            Energy may be low as our immune system hesitates and we become prone to coughs and colds.</p>

            <p>This most acute phase of grief can last several months or more and sometimes much longer. As the feelings
            diminish it\'s tempting to wave them goodbye, only to experience the return of loss and desolation as birthdays,
            anniversaries and Christmas celebrations come around. So it\'s like a carousel, which circles us time and again,
            with varying degrees of intensity and distress.</p>

            <p><em><strong>Over time</strong></em></p>

            <p>The wild swings of the emotional pendulum start to calm down. This is the time of acceptance, a time of
            integrating past and present so that we can slowly put together a different future to that which we had entertained
            in the past. The grieving is softening, and future possibilities beckon. As we re-adjust we may be surprised
            at how we have managed to survive our loss and the extent to which in confronting the fear of loss we have
            lost our fear of living.</p>

            <p>Grieving is hard and much emotional energy is churned up in the process. It is not unusual to cope very
            well with the first few weeks only to be overwhelmed by emotional exhaustion later, once the stress of the event
            is over.</p>]]>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Accept our feelings. They are normal. They are OK. However strange they are part of the
            healing process.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Allow ourselves to cry. We should attend the funeral if possible and talk about our loved one, remembering the
            times of love and laughter, even if that is difficult. In sharing our feelings with a trusted friend, we can
            sometimes talk about things that have long remained private. In visiting places familiar to our loved one, we can
            celebrate the joining of our lives. In seeking out memories of time spent together past happiness can begin to
            soften the burden of grief.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> We may need to take time off our studies or work. If so, it\'s sometimes good to go home or

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> We may need to take time off our studies or work. If so, it\'s sometimes good to go home or

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> We may need to take time off our studies or work. If so, it\'s sometimes good to go home or
            stay with friends for a few days.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> We should take plenty of rest, eat light, frequent meals, and make time for relaxation and
            a little exercise. It\'s not self-indulgent. We need to be kind to ourselves.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> If we try to compensate for poor concentration and lack of motivation by overworking, our time will
            often be unproductive. Little and often will achieve more.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> We need to find someone we can trust, maybe a friend, a colleague, a tutor or a counsellor, who can
            really listen to what is going on inside us. For instance the staff at the Counselling Service is very familiar with
            bereavement and the sorrow that goes with it.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> It\'s tempting to see alcohol, tranquilisers, sleeping pills and other drugs as a means to
            lessen our pain, but there may be a price to pay in not confronting our grief directly.</p>

            <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Grieving can be a very powerful experience. If it never seems to diminish, with both health and work affected,
            it makes sense to seek help. If the desire to self-harm is present, do something about this sooner
            rather than later.</p>

            <p><strong>There is no right way to grieve</strong></p>
            <p><strong>There is only that which brings us comfort and resolution</strong></p>

                <p><em>I\'ve written and rewritten this essay, maybe five times, and I still don\'t feel I can hand it in. The problem
                is that it has taken over my life. I\'ve cut some lectures, left an important assignment for next week which
                I know will cause even more problems, and I am spending all my time just endlessly trying to improve this
                essay. It\'s crazy because I know it\'s probably good enough, but I can\'t help it… I so want it to be
                absolutely right.</em></p>

                <p>Have you heard of the Pareto Principle? It\'s very straightforward and seems to apply across a wide
                range of situations and activities: namely that 20&#37; of our efforts deliver as much as 80&#37; of our results…
                which of course leads to the paradoxical equation that the remaining 80&#37; only delivers a measly 20&#37;!
                The message is that 20&#37; of your efforts are likely to deliver an acceptable, reasonable job - not a
                perfect result, but well above adequate. The additional results are sixteen times more costly.
                It doesn\'t always work out that precisely, but we all know that the extra effort that we put in to
                make something \'perfect\' is rarely cost effective. And of course that extra effort could so easily
                be diverted into other projects, other tasks. As Donald Wetmore has put it, <em>\"Excellence in performance is
                attaining a degree of perfection, not absolute perfection.\"</em></p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Do you feel like what you accomplish is never quite good enough?</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Do you often put off handing in papers or projects, waiting to get them just right?</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Do you feel you must give more than 100&#37; on everything you do or else you will
                be mediocre or even a failure?</p>

                <p>If so, rather than simply working toward success, you may in fact be trying to be perfect - too perfect!</p>

                <p>Perfectionism refers to self-defeating thoughts and behaviours associated with high and unrealistic goals.
                Perfectionism is often mistakenly seen as desirable or even necessary for success. However, recent studies
                have shown that perfectionist attitudes actually interfere with success. The desire to be perfect can
                deny you a sense of satisfaction and cause you to achieve far less than people with more realistic goals.</p>

            <div>
                <p>If you are a perfectionist, it is likely that you learned early in life that you were mainly valued for
                your achievements. As a result you may have learned to value yourself only on the basis of other people\'s approval.
                So your self-esteem may be based primarily on external standards. This can leave you vulnerable and sensitive
                to the opinions and criticism of others. To protect yourself you may decide that being perfect is your only defence.</p>

                <p>Perfectionism is often associated with the following:</p>

                <p><em><strong>Fear of failure</strong></em></p>
                <p>Perfectionists often equate failure to achieve their goals with a lack
                of personal worth or value.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Fear of making mistakes</strong></em></p>
                <p>Perfectionists often equate mistakes with failure. In building their lives around avoiding mistakes,
                perfectionists miss opportunities to learn and grow.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Fear of disapproval</strong></em></p>
                <p>Do you feel you must give more than 100&#37; on everything you do or else you will
                be mediocre or even a failure?</p>

                <p><em><strong>All-or-nothing thinking</strong></em></p>
                <p>Perfectionists frequently believe that they are worthless if their accomplishments are not perfect.
                Perfectionists have difficulty seeing situations in perspective. For example, a straight \'A\' student who receives a \'B\'
                might believe, <em>\'I am a total failure\'</em>.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Over-emphasis on \'should\', \'must\' and \'ought\'</strong></em></p>
                <p>Perfectionists often live with an endless list of rigid rules for what they must accomplish.
                With the emphasis on how everything <strong>has</strong> to be done, perfectionists rarely listen to what they really
                feel like doing.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Never good enough</strong></em></p>
                <p>Perfectionists tend to see others as achieving success with a minimum of effort, few errors,
                little emotional stress, and maximum self-confidence. At the same time, perfectionists view their own
                efforts as unending and forever inadequate.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> You fail to meet this goal because the goal was impossible to begin with. Failure to reach it was always inevitable.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> The constant pressure to achieve perfection and the inevitable chronic failure reduce your productivity

            <div>
                <p><strong>MYTH No.1</strong> I wouldn\'t be the success I am today if I weren\'t such a perfectionist.</p>
                <p><strong>REALITY:</strong> Perfectionism does not lead to success and fulfilment. Although some perfectionists are
                remarkably successful, what they fail to realise is that their success has been achieved despite, not because of,
                their compulsive striving.</p>

                <p>There is no evidence that perfectionists are more successful than their non-perfectionistic counterparts.
                There is evidence that given similar levels of talent, skill or intellect, perfectionists perform less
                successfully than non-perfectionists.</p>

                <p><strong>MYTH No.2</strong> Perfectionists get things done and they do things right.</p>
                <p><strong>REALITY:</strong> Perfectionists often have problems with procrastination, missed deadlines, and low
                productivity.</p>

                <p>Psychologists find that perfectionists tend to be \'all-or-nothing\' thinkers. They see events and
                experiences as good or bad, perfect or imperfect, with nothing in between. Such thinking often leads to
                procrastination, because a requirement of flawless perfection, in even the smallest of tasks, can
                become fearfully overwhelming. The perfectionist believes that the flawless product or superb performance
                must be produced every time. Perfectionists believe if it can\'t be done perfectly, it\'s not worth doing.</p>

                <p>Such beliefs often lead to undesired results. A perfectionist student may turn in a paper weeks late
                (or not at all), rather than turn it in on time with less-than-perfect sentences. A perfectionist worker
                may spend so much time agonising over some non-critical details that a critical project misses its deadline.</p>

                <p><strong>MYTH No.3</strong> Perfectionists are determined to overcome all obstacles to success.</p>
                <p><strong>REALITY:</strong> Although perfectionists follow an \'I\'ll-keep-trying-until-it\'s-perfect\' credo, they are
                especially vulnerable to potentially serious difficulties such as depression, writer\'s block, and performance
                and social anxiety.</p>

                <p>These internal blocks to productivity, achievement, and success result from the perfectionist\'s focus on
                end-products. Instead of concentrating on the process of accomplishing a task, perfectionists focus exclusively
                on the outcome of their efforts. Far from an asset, this relentless pursuit of the ultimate goal becomes the
                perfectionist\'s greatest liability; the resultant sense of overwhelming anxiety often sabotages the
                perfectionist\'s efforts.</p>

                <p><strong>MYTH No.4</strong> Perfectionists just have this enormous desire to please others and to be the very best they can.</p>
                <p><strong>REALITY:</strong> Perfectionistic tendencies often begin as an attempt to win love, acceptance, and approval.</p>

                <p>Perfectionists are driven by low self-esteem, so their own needs ultimately blind them to the needs
                and wishes of others. Indeed, their compulsiveness may lead others to beg for a change that the perfectionist
                cannot or will not make. Perfectionism is more likely to complicate than enhance relationships.</p>

                <p>The \'perfect human\' is as appealing and mythical a concept as the unicorn. Many of our greatest
                endeavours are indeed accomplished while striving to perfect ourselves. Great achievers, like perfectionists,
                want to be and do better. Unlike perfectionists, they are willing to make mistakes and risk failure.
                Great achievers recognise mistakes, failure, and general imperfection as part of the reality of being human.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <div>
                <p>The first step is to realise that perfectionism is undesirable. Perfection is an illusion that is
                unattainable. The next step is to challenge the self-defeating thoughts and behaviours that fuel perfectionism.
                Here are eight strategies:</p>

                <p><em><strong>Realistic Goals</strong></em></p>
                <p>Set realistic and reachable goals based on your own wants and needs and on what you have accomplished in
                the past. This will enable you to achieve and also will lead to a greater sense of self-esteem.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Modest Improvements</strong></em></p>
                <p>Set subsequent goals in a sequential manner. As you reach a goal, set your next goal one level beyond your present level.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Try for less than 100&#37;</strong></em></p>
                <p>Experiment with your standards for success. Choose any activity and instead of aiming for 100&#37;, try for 90&#37;, 80&#37;,
                or even 60&#37; success. This will help you to realise that world does not end when you are not perfect.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Focus on process</strong></em></p>
                <p>Focus on the <em>process</em> of doing an activity not just on the end result. Evaluate your success
                not only in terms of what you accomplished but also in terms of how much you enjoyed the task.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Check your feelings</strong></em></p>
                <p>Use feelings of anxiety and depression as opportunities to ask yourself, <em>\"Have I set up impossible
                expectations for myself in this situation?\"</em></p>

                <p><em><strong>Face your fears</strong></em></p>
                <p>Confront the fears that may be behind your perfectionism by asking yourself, \"What am I afraid of?
                What is the worst thing that could happen?\"</p>

                <p><em><strong>Celebrate your mistakes</strong></em></p>
                <p>Recognise that many positive things can only be learned by making mistakes. When you make a mistake ask, <em>\"What
                can I learn from this experience?\"</em> More specifically, think of a recent mistake you have made and
                list all the things you can learn from it.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Discriminate</strong></em></p>
                <p>Avoid <em>all-or-nothing</em> thinking in relation to your goals. Learn to discriminate the tasks you want
                to give high priority to from those tasks that are less important to you. On less important tasks, choose to
                put forth less effort.</p>

            <div>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> A perfectionist sets standards beyond all reach and reason, whereas a healthy striver
                will set standards that are high, but just beyond reach.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> A perfectionist is never satisfied by anything less than perfection, whereas a healthy
                striver enjoys the process as well as the outcome regardless.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> A perfectionist becomes dysfunctionally depressed when they experience failures and
                disappointment, whereas a healthy striver bounces back from failure and disappointment quickly with energy.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> A perfectionist is pre-occupied with the fear of failure and disapproaval, which can deplete
                their energy levels. A healthy striver keeps normal anxiety, fear of failure and disapproval within bounds, and uses them
                to create energy.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> A perfectionist sees mistakes as evidence of unworthiness, whereas a healthy striver
                sees them as opportunities for growth and learning.</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> A perfectionist becomes overly defensive when criticised, whereas a healthy striver
                reacts positively to helpful criticism.</p>

                <p><strong>The healthy striver has drive, the perfectionist is driven</strong></p>

                <p>Healthy goal setting and striving are quite different from the self-defeating process of perfectionism.
                Healthy strivers tend to set goals based on their own wants and desires rather than primarily in response
                to external expectations. Their goals are usually just one step beyond what they have already accomplished.
                In other words, their goals are realistic, internal, and potentially attainable.</p>

                <p>Healthy strivers take pleasure in the process of pursuing the task at hand rather than focusing only on
                the end result. When they experience disapproval or failure, their reactions are generally limited to
                specific situations rather than generalised to their entire self-worth.</p>

                <p><em>The \'South Indian Monkey Trap\' was developed by villagers to catch the ever-present and numerous
                small monkeys in that part of the world. It involves a hollowed-out coconut chained to a stake. The coconut
                has some rice inside which can be seen through a small hole. The hole is just big enough so that the monkey
                can put his hand in, but too small for his fist to come out after he has grabbed the rice.</em></p>

                <p><em>Tempted by the rice, the monkey reaches in and is suddenly trapped. He is not able to see that it is
                his own fist that traps him, his own desire for the rice. He rigidly holds on to the rice, because he values it.
                He cannot let go and by doing so regain his freedom. So the trap works and the villagers capture him.</em></p>

                <p>Are you trapped by your perfectionist values? Perfectionism is not helpful. It does not have to play a
                part in your life. There are better ways of thinking and living. Not only are you likely to achieve more
                without your perfectionism, but you will feel better about yourself in the process.</p>

                <p>Procrastination is the avoidance or delaying of a task which you need or (at some level) want to do.</p>

                <p>Everyone procrastinates, sometimes.  Certainly most students are familiar with the experience, and the
                feelings that can go with it (frustration, despondency, self-criticism, stress) – in one study, 70&#37; of
                students rated procrastination as a significant problem in their lives.</p>

                <p>This section on student responses to a series of workshops run by staff from the Academic Skills Centre
                and the Counselling Service at the University of Dundee, as well as on self-help books and leaflets.
                It looks at the key stages of noticing when you are procrastinating, understanding why it happens, and some
                strategies for challenging procrastination and moving forward with your studies (or any other aspect of your life).</p>

            <div>
                <p>The word \'procrastination\' comes from the Latin words <em>pro</em>(forward/toward/in favour of) and
                <em>cras</em>(tomorrow). This is a bit misleading though. Sometimes we do procrastinate by saying \'I will do it
                tomorrow\' (or next week, month, year…). But more often we convince ourselves that we are just about to start
                work/study - in five minutes time, or when we have finished off something else.</p>

                <p>We are very good at finding tasks that keep us busy, that may be interesting, entertaining or useful, but which
                disguise the fact that we are avoiding the task that really needs doing right now.
                This is sometimes called \'oven cleaning\' – the idea being that oven cleaning is such a horrible job that we only
                do it to avoid something else.</p>

                <p>Here are some examples of distractions frequently mentioned by students – do you recognise yourself in any of these?</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211; Tidying the desk/cleaning the room</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Organising files on the computer</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Making (another) to-do list</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Making (another) cup of coffee \'before you start\'</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Answering emails/texts</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Internet browsing</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Checking social media accounts</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Playing video games</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#8211; Daydreaming/staring into space</strong></p>

                <p>Some of these are effective distractions because they feel like work, or getting ready to work –
                \'I\'m doing <em>something</em>\'. Others are effective because we can tell ourselves we are not delaying anything –
                \'It will only take 5 minutes\'. Either way, the first step towards challenging procrastination is to notice
                when, and how, we are doing it. Identifying the ways you habitually distract yourself can help set up a
                mental reminder to stop, <em>think</em>, and do something different.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Procrastination is complicated – there are many reasons why people might avoid or put off work that they
                need to do. One writer <em><strong>(Steele 2011)</strong></em> suggests that these reasons break down into
                four main factors as shown below: </p>
            </div>]]>
        </item>

        <item>
            <![CDATA[
            <div>
                <h4 id=headerTag><u>Expectancy (Confidence)</u></h4>

                <p>By <em>\'expectancy\'</em> Steele means your assessment of the likelihood that you will complete the
                task successfully. Low expectations or fear of failure will tend to increase procrastination.</p>

                <p>Students who are very critical of their own work, or perfectionists (who set themselves a very high bar for
                <em>\'success\'</em>); students who have received unexpectedly poor marks for recent coursework; or who are not sure
                what they need to do, or the requirements for success, are all more likely to procrastinate.</p>

                <p>And it is not just about the individual task. An overload of tasks to complete at the same time can
                overwhelm us, making it seem impossible to get started on any of them.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <div>
                <h4 id=headerTag><u>Value</u></h4>

                <p>How important or valuable the task seems to you. The more you care about or feel motivated by an activity,
                the more likely you are to get started, keep going, and complete it. Feeling bored by a task, or resentful
                at having to complete it, makes you more likely to put it off.</p>

                <p>Some students may procrastinate to maintain a sense of their own autonomy and control; others because they
                dislike being alone and feel that isolation is being forced on them by the work. We may find it difficult to
                see what we will gain from completing the coursework/degree, or fear that success will set up expectations
                of us that we can\'t meet in the future.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <div>
                <h4 id=headerTag><u>Time</u></h4>

                <p>Time (and our awareness of it) plays a big part in procrastination. Long delays before a task needs to
                be completed make us less inclined to get started.</p>

                <p>Sometimes we can have a distorted sense of the time available. For example we do not notice the deadline
                until it is very close, or we can underestimate the time that will be taken up by jobs, other classes etc.</p>

                <p>If we lack time structure (clearly defined boundaries between \'work\' hours and \'leisure\', for example)
                it can be hard to focus or concentrate. We can spend many hours stuck in a grey area in between working and
                relaxing, where we are not really doing either.</p>

            <![CDATA[
            <div>
                <h4 id=headerTag><u>Impulsiveness</u></h4>

                <p>This is our tendency to prefer immediate or short-term pleasures or distractions to longer-term rewards. It
                is suggested that some people are naturally more impulsive than others, and therefore more likely to procrastinate.</p>

                <p>But there are also situations which make us all more likely to be impulsive (where the distractions are
                particularly immediate, and the longer-term rewards are particularly remote). And 21st century life is full
                of easy-access technologies to hook our impulsive tendencies such as TV/internet/smartphones/social media/gaming
                – we are \'drowning in distractions\'.</p>

                <p>Taking these four factors into account, Steele suggests that writing university coursework is a
                \'perfect storm\' for procrastination for several reasons:</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Studying is designed to be hard, to challenge what you know and take you out of your comfort
                zone. The rewards of putting the work in – understanding, confidence, better grades - can seem unpredictable, or slow
                to arrive (low expectancy).</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Writing coursework can be a difficult, painful, personal process – something that we do out of
                necessity rather than choice, for a degree or career that looks a long way away (low value).</p>

                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Deadlines are often weeks or months after the coursework is assigned (high delay).</p>
                <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Writing on a computer as most of us do, our \'workstation\' is loaded with distractions that
                are one click away. There is also very little separation between workspaces and social spaces in student life – the library
                is very close to the Student Union (high impulsiveness).</p>

            <div>
                <p>So what to do? As procrastination is a such a complex and tricky problem, we don\'t think there is one
                single solution that will remove it from our lives. Here is a selection of strategies that might help,
                offered not as a complete set of instructions, but as a menu - try one or two strategies that looks promising,
                and see what difference, if any, they make.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Use The \'Power of Routine\'</strong></em></p>
                <p>Treat studying like a job - plan your working week, ideally with fairly regular working hours. If not
                \'Monday to Friday, 9 to 5\', then what?</p>

                <p><em><strong>Plan Study Periods and Breaks</strong></em></p>
                <p>Alternate between studying and resting, such as45 minutes on, 15 minutes off. Make a commitment to
                keep working until the 45 minutes are up. Use an alarm or timer to take the decision out of your hands
                (look up the <em>\'Pomodoro technique\'</em> for more on this idea).</p>

                <p><em><strong>Plan Ahead</strong></em></p>
                <p>Make sure everything is ready to begin studying the night before so that you can get started, this can set
                the mood for the whole day.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Adopt a Time-Focused Approach</strong></em></p>
                <p>This can help avoid feeling overwhelmed by what there is to be done. <strong>E.g.</strong> instead of asking
                <em>\'how long will it take me to read this article\'</em>, allocate 1 or 2 hours and make the question
                <em>\'How much can I get from the article in the time available?\'</em></p>

                <p><em><strong>Set Realistic Targets</strong></em></p>
                <p>Be realistic about what can be done today. Making promises to yourself that you don\'t meet can be
                discouraging. <em>\'Promise a little, but deliver the lot\'.</em></p>

                <p><em><strong>Take Time Out</strong></em></p>
                <p>If you feel stuck. Do something different, preferably something active, and come back with a fresh perspective.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Make Plans</strong></em></p>
                <p>Daily/weekly \'to do\' lists can give you a clear, and limited, sense of focus. So can a semester plan –
                mapping out key tasks for the semester on a calendar so that the deadlines, including any clusters, can be
                visualised.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Identify Priorities</strong></em></p>
                <p>Long lists can feel overwhelming and we can become focused on crossing off as many items as possible,
                regardless of their urgency. Use an <strong>ABC system</strong> where <strong>A</strong> = essential now,
                <strong>B</strong> = will be essential soon and <strong>C</strong> = not essential but useful, to
                identify priorities.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Turn Goals Into Tasks</strong></em></p>
                <p>A <em>\'goal\'</em> is an overall aim <strong>e.g.</strong> completing an assignment, which can be broken
                down into <em>\'tasks\'</em> such as <strong>reading, planning, drafting etc.</strong> Limited,
                time-specific tasks make better targets than overall goals; <em>\'Saturday morning – write introduction\'</em>
                rather than <em>\'Weekend – do essay\'.</em></p>

                <p><em><strong>Join Forces</strong></em></p>
                <p>Find a <em>\'study buddy\'</em> or form a study group.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Reward Yourself</strong></em></p>
                <p>Mark the completion of a task, a study period, or a working day, by treating yourself. Turn the distractions
                such as Facebook, TV, chocolate into rewards</p>

                <p><em><strong>Start Somewhere Else</strong></em></p>
                <p>If it\'s hard to start at the beginning, start in the middle. If what you do normally isn\'t working,
                do something different.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Remind Yourself of Past Successes</strong></em></p>
                <p>Both in past years and more recently – what skills, factors or people helped you to be effective? How
                could these be transferred to the current task?</p>

                <p><em><strong>Imagine Your Future Self</strong></em></p>
                <p>Picture you, in 10 years time, looking back on your current challenges. What advice would your future
                self give your current self? What would they say to encourage you?</p>

                <p><em><strong>Adopt A \'Good Enough (For Now)\' Perspective</strong></em></p>
                <p>Don\'t ask <em>\'have I read and understood everything?\'</em>. Instead ask <em>\'have I read enough to
                get me started?\'</em>. Don\'t ask <em>\'Is this sentence/paragraph/assignment perfect?\'</em> but
                <em>\'Is it good enough for a first draft?\'</em></p>

                <p><em><strong>Tell Yourself \'I Am Not My Work\'</strong></em></p>
                <p>Your studies are not who you are, they are what you do. There are always constraints of time and resources on
                what you can achieve. Any judgement on your work is not a judgement of you as a person.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Identify What Motivates You</strong></em></p>
                <p>Change <em>\'I have to do this\'</em> to <em>\'I choose to do this because…\'</em> or even better,
                <em>\'This is interesting because…\'</em></p>

                <p><em><strong>Identify What De-Motivates You</strong></em></p>
                <p>Write down why you don\'t want to do the task – what seems difficult, boring, frustrating, unappealing about it.
                Then put that piece of paper away in a drawer and carry on.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Write Encouraging Messages to Yourself</strong></em></p>
                <p>Your words or other people\'s…</p>

                <p><em><strong>Exercise/Move/Relax Your Body</strong></em></p>
                <p>Breathe deeply and slowly, tense and relax muscle groups, stretch, jog on the spot, dance/sing…anything
                that generates a bit of energy.</p>

                <p><em><strong>Forgive Yourself for Sometimes Procrastinating</strong></em></p>
                <p>Accept that what you are doing is difficult. Support and encourage yourself the way you would a good friend.
                The ideas in this section are intended to promote a spirit of compassionate curiosity about your procrastination,
                not self-blame. There is good evidence that relentless self-criticism doesn\'t help people to overcome
                procrastination - it just makes them more unhappy about it, and can lead to further problems, such as the mental
                health issues discussed in this section of the app.</p>

                    <p>​Self harm can be very hard to understand, both for the people who do it and for those who support them.</p>

                    <p>The main thing to realise, and accept about it though, is that it is a way of coping.
                    It is not madness, or attention seeking, or a suicide attempt. There are always very powerful reasons
                    why a person chooses to injure self and, self-destructive though it may seem, self-injury is a way
                    of surviving usually in the face of great emotional pain.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>Self-Injury Is A Sign of Deep Disturbance or Madness</strong></em></p>
                    <p>This is not true. It is a sign of distress and of someone trying to cope with his/her life despite
                    great pain. Many people who self-injure lead successful lives and have careers or families.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>Self-Injury is A Failed Suicide Attempt</strong></em></p
                    <p>It is a way of coping with life, not dying. Injuries are seldom life threatening. A person may want
                    to kill the feeling - not themselves. It is a way of surviving through life.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>Someone Who Self-Injures Is A Danger To Others</strong></em></p>
                    <p>Self-injury is directed at self not others. Most people who self injure would never consider hurting someone else.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>It Is Attention Seeking And Should Be Ignored</strong></em></p>
                    <p>Everyone needs attention. For some, self-injury is a desperate attempt to draw attention to what is wrong and
                    it\'s right that they should have attention paid to their distress and its causes. Many people who self-injure
                    hide their injuries from others.</p>

                    <p>It has far more to do with coping than with seeking attention. The attention that self-injury attracts is
                    usually very negative and further hurtful for the person concerned. Seldom does it lead to a man/woman feeling
                    better about themselves or to relieving the distress that caused it.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>Self-Injury Is Done To Manipulate Others</strong></em></p>
                    <p>This can be the case s with actions such as crying and talking. However, by far the most important
                    motivation is that it helps a person cope. It is not about the effects of it on others.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>Self-Injury Is An Addiction Or Habit, Which Should Be Stopped</strong></em></p>
                    <p>A person self-harms because he/she is distressed and it may be a coping mechanism, which has been
                    habitually used. It is not the behaviour, which is the problem but the pain and distress that gives rise to it.
                    If they are stopped they may develop different coping strategies or hide what they are doing.</p>

                    <p>​<em><strong>People Who Self-Injure Enjoy Pain Or Do Not Feel It</strong></em></p>
                    <p>This is not true. They may feel that they deserve pain or it may help them cope with a deeper emotional
                    pain. Some people feel nothing at the time of injuring but later suffer from the wounds or burns.</p>

            <![CDATA[<h1 id=headerTag>Self-Injury As Control Mechanism</h1>]]>

            <![CDATA[
                <div>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> The reasons for self-injury are complex and can vary from individual to individual.
                    Self-injury almost always begins in response to painful and difficult experiences in the individual\'s life.
                    Sometimes these stem from childhood trauma, though it can also be part of distress experienced in adulthood.</p>

                    <p>Often there is no single cause that can be identified for self-injury, but it comes from a number of factors
                    combining together in life which increase vulnerability and lead to a need to cope, or express feelings
                    through self-injury.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> One of the ways that self-injury helps someone cope is by giving them some way,
                    however painful, of dealing with feelings. Many people who self-injure feel unbearable distress, fear and
                    tension. Self-injury can act as a kind of safety valve and bring a sense of great relief, which can help the
                    individual cope better with their life.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Self-injury can be about self-blame and turning anger inwardly. The person may take on all the
                    responsibility for events that they can\'t control and self-injure in order to punish self. The person may really believe
                    that they deserve to hurt.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Sometimes self-injury can feel like the only way that a person can release their feelings. They may feel
                    angry, sad or anguished, frustrated and unable to shout, cry or speak to someone. The individual may have no other means of
                    registering protest or releasing feelings. Self-injury can, for individuals at the time, be the only means of expressing
                    their feelings.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Self-injury can be a way of avoiding feelings. It can be used as a means of numbing or
                    distracting from the distress the individual is feeling. In this way the pain can distract away from other emotions that
                    they are unable or unwilling to feel or deal with at that time. Pain can take individuals away from more uncomfortable
                    feelings.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Some individuals feel that if they did not release some of the emotional distress through
                    self-injury, then they would commit suicide. So the self-injury is about staying alive and not, as often perceived, as a
                    suicide attempt.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Self-injury can be a way that individuals take control over an aspect of their life. This may be
                    the only thing that they feel they have the power to control.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Self-injury can be a way of trying to communicate. An individual may need to make the pain visible to them
                    and others. It can serve as a way of proving that they are hurting and need care or it may be a protest about something.
                    The person may feel they have no other means of communicating feelings.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> People may self-injure because they cannot ask for support in any other way. They may never have learned to ask
                    for support; or comfort and support has always been denied. Only through the self-injury can they ask for support -
                    ironically, support is then often denied because people misunderstand self-injury.</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Self-injury may not, to the outside world, seem a logical thing to do, yet, for many it serves the very
                    practical purpose of helping her/him cope and keep alive. It has its own logic and serves a function for the individual
                    at the time.</p>

                <p>First of all, let\'s check out a few symptoms to see how overtired you are. If you feel under stress -
                emotionally, mentally or physically - then maybe some of the following symptoms are present.
                They can of course derive from many other causes, but if several are present together, an overstressed condition
                is probably a major factor in their origin.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Stress relates to the degree of internal and external stimulus that we are subjected to. Too little stimulus
                and we are bored. Too much and our coping mechanisms become ineffective and we start to show symptoms of
                over-tiredness. It\'s tempting, when we are overstressed, to point to a recent problem that could be responsible.
                However it\'s often the case that we are actually dealing with several issues that have slowly worn down our
                resistance to stress over a period of months - maybe longer - leaving us mentally and emotionally exhausted.</p>

                <p>Our ability to tolerate stress is linked to our personality, our relationships, energy levels, and emotional
                maturity. For instance, introverted people are generally more comfortable with less stimulus than their more
                extroverted colleagues, unhappy relationships tend to be very draining and lower our resistance to stress;
                when our energy levels are reduced, <strong>e.g.</strong> recovering from illness or simply tired at the end of the day,
                our ways of dealing with the world around us are less robust; finally, as we grow older, we generally learn how to deal
                more confidently with sources of stress, be they work-related or personal.</p>

                <p>In everyday life - i.e. non-crisis situations - it\'s important to make effective use of our <strong>limited</strong>
                 energy. To do so means getting the right balance between work, rest and play.</p>

                <p>Because of the nature of our society, with its emphasis on work, achievement and competition, people\'s lives
                consist mostly of work periods and \'convalescent\' rest periods when we are recovering from work.
                In such resting periods, we usually opt for predictable routine activities such as chatting to friends,
                housework, going out to the pub, watching TV, reading newspapers, etc. <em>We opt for the comfort zone!</em></p>

                <p>But play is important too! Without it we don\'t function very well in the long run. We need play to see
                work in perspective, diffuse the everyday anxieties and recharge our mental energy. Yet when you look around
                and ask most people how much play there is in their week, the answers are often very revealing. Each week we
                have <strong>168 hours</strong> which is spent in roughly the following proportions:</p>

                <p><em><strong>Routine activities such as sleep and eat - 100 hrs</strong></em></p>
                <p><em><strong>Leisure time such as rest and play - 33 hrs</strong></em></p>
                <p><em><strong>Work - 35 hrs</strong></em></p>

                <p>And what happens in leisure time? Well, there\'s a lot of resting but not much evidence of play. For instance,
                the <strong>average Briton spends about 17 hrs per week watching TV</strong>. And although there are plenty of
                opportunities for play, such as golf and hill walkers - to mention but two activities in Scotland, the active
                seem to be outnumbered by the spectators.</p>

                <p><em><strong>What is play?</strong></em></p>
                <p>There\'s no easy answer. For each person, it\'s different. However, to be effective, it needs to be
                absorbing, creative, to exercise different talents to those employed in our work, and to present us with
                meaningful challenges. And of course, we need energy to enjoy it! Whereas the resting periods, when we are low
                in energy, are devoted to mostly grey, mechanical activities, play requires a positive investment
                of effort and enthusiasm.</p>

                <p>It\'s not easy to think of work when you are walking in the Cairngorms, playing a vigorous game of squash
                or trying to capture the spirit of a landscape with a camera or a box of water colours.</p>

                <p>When we become anxious about work topics such as when we are trying to meet a deadline, or revising, play is
                often dismissed as <em>\'selfish\', \'irrelevant\' or \'self-indulgent\'.</em> However vital it remains to
                our sense of well-being, it is often the first item to be squeezed out of the week, as we rationalise the
                need to devote more time and effort to work.</p>

                <p>A stressful situation often develops its own momentum, creating a vicious circle, where the lack of relief
                from the pressures of work results in us inevitably becoming more and more overtired, so that work periods offer
                ever diminishing returns, often reaching the point where we stare at the page, and nothing seems to <em>\'go in\'.</em></p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211; Rest properly. That means relaxing away from all signs of work and new sources of stress
                    such as harrowing television news programmes.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211; Reintroduce play periods. Try to make them at least 3-4 hours in duration.</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211; Monitor the changes, and - if they work - make them a permanent feature of your life.</strong></p>

                    <p>You will derive very little benefit from play periods of less than three hours. But try telling that
                    to someone who is already past deadlines on two essays, a week away from class exams and expecting a
                    letter from the bank manager about an overdraft! However the only way to effectively dispel the feelings
                    of anxiety and guilt is to step back and make some radical changes.</p>

                    <p>The most contented people are often to be found among those who have regular commitments outside their
                    work; and who are determined, whatever the nature of the work-related pressures, to make sure that these
                    activities are not drummed out of existence.</p>

                    <p>To recap, the <strong>essential element that allows us to work effectively</strong> is the presence of
                    about <strong>4-6 hours of play per week</strong> - of spare-time events or activities that we really look
                    forward to. The absence of play is not noticed immediately. But, in retrospect, it is marked by a
                    gradual downswing in our overall effectiveness. Ignore its absence for too long, and our world
                    starts to turn a shade of grey.</p>

                    <p>What can you do to reduce your over-tiredness and inability to cope effectively?</p>

                    <p>A great deal. The first step is to take stock of the situation. Then make some changes in how you manage
                    your time, and see whether they give you a feeling of being more relaxed and more in control.
                    The ideas that follow may prove useful. Try them out!</p>

                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Work no more than eight hours daily</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Always set yourself realistic targets for each work period</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Work methodically! Always finish one task before starting another</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Don\'t accept, or set yourself, unrealistic deadlines. Unfulfilled resolutions will only
                    make you feel guilty and inadequate</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  If you\'re unhappy in your work, stand back. Take a fresh look at your options and
                    the goals towards which you are striving</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Have one and a half days each week completely free from work</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Take as much care in planning your leisure as you do in your work</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Take weekends away from the University and your work</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  In your leisure periods make sure that all reminders of work such as textbooks,
                    notes, etc. are out of sight</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Try to walk, talk and move at a slower pace</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Deliberately cultivate the habit of listening to relaxing music</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Find a relaxing activity - one that\'s creative rather than competitive such as pottery,
                    photography, drawing, model-making, tapestry, knitting, playing an instrument. Set time aside for it each day</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Take at least 15 minutes daily for physical exercise, preferably outdoors, so that you get
                    the added benefit of fresh air and full-spectrum light</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  For some people, daily sessions practising yoga/meditation or listening to relaxation
                    tapes, may be very beneficial</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Allow at least 30 minutes for each meal</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Examine your diet! Make sure that it is balanced and provides you with plenty of energy</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  Eat slowly and chew well to extract maximum benefit from your food</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong>  If emotional and/or sexual relationships are upsetting you, seek advice, now</p>
                    <p><strong>&#8211;</strong> Practice being less defensive. Express more of your feelings openly</p>
